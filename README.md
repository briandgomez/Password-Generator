## Password Generator

# Description
A password generator is used to create random passwords for users.The user can decide what they want to be part of the password such as letters (uppercase or lowercase), numbers, and special characters. The user must also select at least 1 of theses options in order for the generator to run. A password generator allows people to create complex passwords for them instead of having to do it themselves. This is useful in todays society because many applications such as emails and social media websites require complex passwords to use them. This project was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
